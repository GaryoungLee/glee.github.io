### Evolution of Newell-type Car-following Model
<br>

##### 1️⃣ Newell's Car-following model
\color{grey}{Newell, G. F. (2002). A simplified car-following theory: a lower order model. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 36(3), 195-205.} [Download](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0191-2615(00)00044-8)

Newell's model is based on the LWR kinematic wave theory with triangular fundamental diagram which has three parameters: free-flow speed $$ u$$, wave speed, $$-w$$, and jam density $$k_j$$. The model gives an exact solution: 

$$
x_{i}(t)=\min\{\underbrace{x_{i}(t-\tau)+ \color{red}{u \tau}}_{\text{free-flow (Y)}},\ \underbrace{x_{i-1}(t-\tau)-\delta}_{\text{congestion (Z)}} \} 
$$


where $$ x_{i}(t)$$ is the postion of vehicle $$i$$ at time $$t$$,  $$ \tau = \frac{1}{wk_j} $$ is a wave trip time between two consecutive trajectories, and $$ \delta = \frac{1}{k_j}$$ is the jam spacing. Here, $$u\tau$$ is a deterministic vehicle displacement between $$t-\tau $$ and $$t$$.


##### 2️⃣ Extension of Newell's model with stochastic desired acceleration (Brownian Motion)
